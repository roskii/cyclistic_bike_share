As part of <b>Google's Data Analytics Professional Certification</b>, an optional capstone project can be completed to round off the course. Google provided two recommended case studies, each based off of open-sourced data sets. 

I selected first case study option - a bike-sharing service provided in the city of Chicago. Data is licensed by "Bikeshare", an LCC operated by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, under City of Chicago's ("City") Divvy bicycle sharing service. For the purposes of this case study, a fictional company title of 'Cyclistic' was used.
